    <p class="readingbox terror-readingbox">
      Emily had always been a timid child. She had an overactive imagination
      that often got the better of her, especially when it came to bedtime. Her
      room, adorned with stuffed animals and colorful posters, should have been
      a sanctuary, but for Emily, it was a place of dread.<br />
      <br />
      It all began with a shadow she noticed under her bed. Every night, when
      the lights were out, she could see it lurking there, a formless darkness
      that seemed to shift and coil like smoke. She would call for her parents,
      but they would dismiss it as just another one of her childhood fears. "No,
      sweetie, there's no such thing as monsters," her mother would say with a
      comforting smile.<br />
      <br />
      But Emily knew better. She knew there was something under her bed,
      something sinister that waited for her to close her eyes. One fateful
      night, Emily mustered up the courage to leave her bed. She had a small
      night light in the corner of her room, casting a soothing blue glow across
      the floor. She could see the shadowy figure under her bed clearer than
      ever.<br />
      <br />
      Her heart pounded as she cautiously stepped off her bed and onto the
      blue-lit floor. She knelt down, her eyes locked onto the darkness beneath
      the bed. To her astonishment, the shadow took form, and Emily gasped in
      horror as she saw a grotesque, twisted creature with elongated limbs and a
      mouth full of sharp, jagged teeth. "I know you're there," Emily whispered,
      her voice trembling.

    <p class="readingbox terror-readingbox">
      The monster let out a low, guttural growl, and Emily's fear intensified.
      But she remembered a story her grandmother had once told her. A story
      about a game that could save you from monsters. Tic Tac Toe.<br />
      <br />
      With trembling hands, Emily drew a makeshift Tic Tac Toe grid on the floor
      using her finger, and she challenged the monster to a game. To her
      surprise, the creature responded by drawing a circle in one of the
      squares. They played the game in silence, Emily's heart pounding with each
      move. She managed to win the first round, and the monster let out a
      grumbling sigh.<br />
      <br />
      As she wiped the sweat from her brow, Emily realized that the monster
      wasn't as invincible as it seemed. By the time the third round had begun,
      Emily had won twice, and the monster's growls grew louder and more
      menacing. But it was her turn to make the final move, and she placed her
      "X" in the winning spot.<br />
      <br />
      With a triumphant smile, Emily watched as the monster let out a
      blood-curdling screech and vanished into thin air. The room was once again
      bathed in the soft blue glow of the night light. Relieved, Emily climbed
      back into her bed and drifted into a restless sleep.<br />
      <br />
      The next night, Emily awoke to a whispering voice in the darkness. "Would
      you like to play again?" it hissed. Emily turned on her night light and
      froze in terror. The monster had returned, and this time, it wasn't alone.
      A legion of shadowy creatures surrounded her bed, each one eager to
      challenge her to another game of Tic Tac Toe. And as Emily realized that
      there was no escape from the relentless monsters under her bed, she
      couldn't help but scream.<br />
      <br />
      ~the end~
