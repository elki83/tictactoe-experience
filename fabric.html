    <p class="readingbox fabric-readingbox">
      In the heart of a once-thriving industrial town, there stood an old,
      decrepit fabric mill. The mill was a relic of a bygone era, a place where
      generations of child laborers had toiled away their youth in the name of
      profit. It was a place stained with sorrow and tragedy, none more so than
      the story of young Mary.<br />
      <br />
      In the midst of the relentless machinery and deafening clatter of the
      looms, Mary had been just another child laborer, struggling to survive in
      the unforgiving world of the late 19th century. She had been a small,
      frail girl, her eyes filled with a silent determination that belied her
      tender years.<br />
      <br />
      One fateful day, tragedy struck. The fabric mill owner, a ruthless man
      named Mr. Witherspoon, had cut corners to save money. The machinery
      malfunctioned, causing a catastrophic accident. Mary, in a desperate
      attempt to save a fellow child worker, found herself caught in the
      merciless gears of the loom. Her life was snuffed out in an instant.<br />
      <br />
      As the years passed, the fabric mill fell into disrepair, and it became
      known as the most haunted place in town. Locals whispered tales of strange
      occurrences, of unexplained noises, and of a ghostly figure that would
      sometimes appear among the abandoned looms. Mary's spirit, consumed by
      fury over her untimely death, had transformed into a Poltergeist, wreaking
      havoc on anyone who dared to enter.<br />
      <br />
      It was on a gloomy, overcast day that a young man named Daniel ventured to
      the fabric mill. Armed with a camera and an insatiable curiosity, he hoped
      to capture the eerie beauty of the decaying building. As he stepped
      through the broken doorway, he couldn't help but shiver, feeling the
      weight of history and tragedy that hung heavy in the air. It didn't take
      long for Daniel to encounter the restless spirit. A sudden chill filled
      the room, and a spectral figure materialized before him. Mary's eyes
      blazed with an otherworldly anger.

    <p class="readingbox fabric-readingbox">
      "Why have you come here?" she hissed, her voice a chilling echo of the
      past. Daniel, though terrified, stammered out his intention to photograph
      the abandoned fabric mill. He had no desire to disturb the spirit of the
      place, but he couldn't turn back now. Mary, her rage palpable, demanded an
      answer to a single question: "Do you know the name of the child who died
      here?" With a lump in his throat, Daniel hesitated, then whispered,
      "Mary."<br />
      <br />
      The spirit's eyes flickered with surprise and sadness. "You know my name,"
      she said, her voice softening. Over time, Daniel learned the story of
      Mary's tragic death and the anger that had consumed her. He listened as
      she recounted the pain and suffering of her short life, the cruelty of Mr.
      Witherspoon, and the injustice of it all. Mary had spent years as a
      vengeful spirit, but deep down, she was lonely and trapped by her own
      anger.<br />
      <br />
      One day, as Daniel explored the fabric mill, he discovered a discarded
      wooden board with a rough sketch of a Tic Tac Toe grid. An idea struck
      him. He set up a game, placing "X" and "O" marks on the board. When Mary
      noticed, she hesitated, curiosity shining in her spectral eyes. "Would you
      like to play a game?" Daniel asked, his voice trembling.<br />
      <br />
      Mary, for the first time in ages, agreed. They played the game of Tic Tac
      Toe, the pieces moving silently across the board. As the game progressed,
      Daniel sensed Mary's anger and vengeful spirit slowly ebbing away. In the
      end, he allowed her to win, placing the final "O" to complete her
      victory.<br />
      <br />
      As Mary gazed at the board, something remarkable happened. Her form began
      to waver, and she looked at Daniel with a mixture of gratitude and relief.
      She whispered, "Thank you." With those words, Mary's spirit faded,
      vanishing into the unknown. The fabric mill, once haunted by her vengeful
      presence, was filled with an eerie stillness.<br />
      <br />
      Daniel knew that Mary had found the peace she had long sought. He left the
      fabric mill, his camera filled with images of the place that had held a
      tragic secret for so many years. He also carried with him the knowledge
      that sometimes, even the most restless souls could find solace, if only
      given a chance.<br />
      <br />And as he walked away from the haunted mill, he couldn't help but
      feel that Mary's story was one that deserved to be told, a story of
      redemption and release that would live on long after the fabric mill had
      crumbled into dust.<br />
      <br />
      ~the end~
