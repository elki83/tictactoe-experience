    <p class="readingbox gate-readingbox">
      For as long as he could remember, David had been drawn to the ancient gate
      that stood at the edge of the forest near his small hometown. The gate was
      said to lead to a place of mystery and wonder, but it was also rumored to
      be haunted. Most townsfolk avoided it, considering it a relic of a
      forgotten era.<br />
      <br />
      One moonless night, as David gazed at the gate from a distance, he heard a
      faint, eerie voice calling to him. At first, he dismissed it as his
      imagination playing tricks on him. But the voice grew stronger, more
      insistent, until it felt as though it was inside his head. "Come closer,
      David," the voice whispered, chilling his spine.<br />
      <br />
      He cautiously approached the gate, wondering if he was dreaming or losing
      his sanity. The voice seemed to emanate from the darkness beyond the gate.
      "What do you want?" David asked, his voice quivering. "I want to play a
      game," the voice replied, now taking on an unsettling, disembodied
      laughter.<br />
      <br />
      David hesitated, but his curiosity got the better of him. "What kind of
      game?" The voice explained the rules. It was a game of Tic Tac Toe, but
      with a sinister twist. David was to play against an unknown entity on the
      other side of the gate.<br />
      <br />
      If he won, he could pass through, but if he lost, he would belong to the
      entity forever. With trembling hands, David agreed to the game. He drew
      the Tic Tac Toe grid on the ground, and on the other side, he heard a
      soft, ghostly hand making its move.

    <p class="readingbox gate-readingbox">
      The game was intense, and David felt the weight of his very soul hanging
      in the balance. He managed to win, placing his final "X" in the winning
      spot. The gate creaked open, and he cautiously passed through.<br />
      <br />
      As the first light of dawn broke, David felt relieved. He had won the
      game, and the mysterious entity had disappeared. The world on the other
      side of the gate appeared serene and untouched by time. But something had
      changed within him.<br />
      <br />
      As days turned into weeks, those who knew David began to notice a shift in
      his personality. He became distant, aloof, and his once-friendly demeanor
      had turned cold and calculating. David himself felt like a passenger in
      his own body, observing his actions as if from a distance. Slowly, the
      truth began to emerge.<br />
      <br />
      The entity from beyond the gate had not vanished; it had taken up
      residence within him. It had merged with his consciousness, and David was
      no longer in control of his own destiny. The once-curious young man was
      now a vessel for a malevolent force, trapped within his own body, while
      the entity played a deadly game of Tic Tac Toe with the souls of those who
      dared to pass through the gate.<br />
      <br />
      And as David watched helplessly from within, he realized that he had
      become the gatekeeper, forever bound to the ancient portal, forced to lure
      others into the same nightmarish fate he now endured.<br />
      <br />
      ~the end~
