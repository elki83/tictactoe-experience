    <p class="readingbox forest-readingbox">
      It was a crisp autumn day when a group of adventurous children from the
      small town of Willowbrook decided to embark on a test of courage. Armed
      with flashlights and boundless curiosity, they ventured into the depths of
      the dark and eerie forest that bordered their town. The goal was simple:
      to explore the forest and emerge unscathed.<br />
      <br />
      As they ventured deeper into the woods, the trees grew thicker, and the
      sunlight dimmed. Soon, it was so dark that it felt like night, even though
      the sun still hung high in the sky. Unease crept over the children, but
      they pressed on, each one trying to outdo the others in bravery. One by
      one, they began to vanish.<br />
      <br />
      First, it was Sarah, the youngest of the group, who let out a startled cry
      and disappeared into the inky blackness. Then followed Mark, then Jessica,
      until only one child remained— a young boy named Ethan. Ethan's heart
      raced as he stood alone in the silent, shadowy forest. Fear clawed at his
      chest, and he wished desperately to turn back. But something held him
      there, an irresistible force that seemed to pull him deeper into the
      gloom.<br />
      <br />
      And then, from the darkness emerged a presence, a shadow darker than the
      darkest night. It had no discernible features, no eyes, no mouth, nothing
      but an abyss of blackness. Ethan's breath caught in his throat as he
      stared at the shadow, unable to move, frozen by fear. The shadow spoke,
      its voice a whisper that sent shivers down his spine.

    <p class="readingbox forest-readingbox">
      "Would you like to play a game?" it asked, its voice echoing eerily
      through the trees. Ethan stammered, "W-what kind of game?" The shadow
      explained the rules. It was a game of Tic Tac Toe, a simple game, but the
      stakes were high. If Ethan won, the shadow would release his friends, and
      they would all return safely to the town. But if he lost, he would become
      a permanent resident of the shadowy forest.<br />
      <br />
      With trembling hands, Ethan agreed to the wager, and they drew a Tic Tac
      Toe grid on the ground with sticks and stones. The game was tense, and
      Ethan's every move felt like a battle against the encroaching darkness.
      But somehow, he managed to win, placing his final "X" in the winning
      spot.<br />
      <br />
      The shadow let out a sigh, and its form wavered. With a final, whispered
      farewell, it vanished into the inky blackness, leaving Ethan standing
      alone in the forest. Suddenly, the world seemed to shift around him. The
      forest was no longer dark, and the sounds of birds chirping and leaves
      rustling filled the air.<br />
      <br />
      Ethan blinked in confusion and looked around. His friends stood beside
      him, as if they had never disappeared. But when he tried to talk to them
      about the shadow and the game of Tic Tac Toe, they looked at him with
      blank expressions, as if he was speaking a language they couldn't
      understand. None of them remembered anything about the forest or the
      ordeal they had just faced. Frightened and bewildered, they ran out of the
      woods and back to the safety of their town.<br />
      <br />
      Ethan, however, couldn't forget the shadow and the sinister game. He made
      a solemn promise to himself never to engage in dangerous dares or tests of
      courage again. And as the years passed, Ethan kept his promise, knowing
      that some dares were not worth the risk, and some shadows were best left
      undisturbed.<br />
      <br />
      ~the end~
